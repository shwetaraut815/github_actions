How a runner actually works (step-by-step)

Let’s break the execution flow mechanically.

Step 1: Event happens

Example:

on: push


A push to repo occurs.

Step 2: Workflow is triggered

GitHub reads:

.github/workflows/ci.yml

Step 3: Job is scheduled
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest


GitHub decides:

Which runner type?

Is runner available?

Step 4: Runner picks the job

Runner:

Registers itself with GitHub

Polls for jobs

Locks the job (no other runner touches it)

Step 5: Code is pulled

This step is mandatory (people forget this):

- uses: actions/checkout@v4


Without this → repo code is NOT present.

Step 6: Steps execute sequentially
steps:
  - run: npm install
  - run: npm test


Inside the runner:

Shell is opened

Commands executed

Exit codes captured

If any step fails → job fails.

Step 7: Logs + status sent back

Runner:

Streams logs

Sends success/failure

Gets terminated (GitHub-hosted)
